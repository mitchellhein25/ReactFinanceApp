• In need of a finance application to suit my needs for my own budget and finance tracking, I decided to build my own.

• Utilized the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) along with Material UI styling, Redux state management, and the Axios HTTP client.

• The application implements simple authentication, tracks the user's net worth, budget, and expense trends over time, and enables manual expense, income, and account tracking with CRUD operations.
